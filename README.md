# Face Recognition Server
This repository contains a server-side code implementation for performing facial recognition using deep learning models. The server allows clients to send images and receive predictions about the identities of the faces present in those images.

Features
Facial Recognition: The server utilizes deep learning algorithms to recognize faces in images and provides predictions about their identities.
1. Client-Server Architecture: Clients can send images to the server via API calls and receive predictions in response.
2. Scalability: The server is designed to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, making it suitable for deployment in production environments.
3. Model Management: The code includes functionality for managing and updating the facial recognition model.
4. Logging and Monitoring: The server logs events and errors, enabling monitoring and troubleshooting.
## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Flask
3. TensorFlow
4. OpenCV
